# Protobuf-learn-1

Purpose of this project is for me to learn how to use protobuf.

Furthermore, I'd like to verify, if the ecosystem and tooling built around
protobuf in nodejs is mature enough to be used in another project I'm building.

# General

The following sections describe the general setup of the project and how to get started.

## Installation

Use the package manager `npm` to install dependencies.

This project uses `standard-version` to create releases.
